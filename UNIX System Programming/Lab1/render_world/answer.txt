The 'linker name' of a shared library is free of any version information (libsmfl-_____.so)
and exists solely as a symbolic link to the 'soname' or in some cases the 'real name' of the 
library.

The 'soname' of the libraries referenced in the 'render-world' application are listed with
version 2.5 (libsfml-______.so.2.5, 2nd through 4th in the list in the image). This name acts
as a symbolic link to the 'real name' of the library, and is embedded in the executable during
linking, after compilation. Used to identify the latest compatible major version of the library.

The 'real name' of these libraries can be found in the next screenshot with the final version
(libsmfl-______2.5.1), this is the name of the actual binary file for the lib, containing
the library code

The OS uses these names as symbolic links to each other in a sort of cascade, beginning
with the 'linker name', linking to the 'soname', which then links to the 'real name'
