My code is basically trying to emulate the functionality of the string class in the java base library.
I had to create a handful of the methods that come along with the java base string class such as "charAt" and "equals".
I tried to make it as simple as I could but also as secure as possible, covering things like trying to print a 'null'
char array, and invalid index exceptions.
